These files contain a simple hack to the elk code to produce ELF.OUT
with the clm-style description of the elf. The patch applies to the
6.3.2 version of elk, but it is easy to adapt to newer versions of the
code. Use the new OUT files with critic2 like this:

LOAD STATE.OUT GEOMETRY.OUT ELF.OUT

-- A.
